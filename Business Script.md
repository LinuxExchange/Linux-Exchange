# Linux-Exchange

Due to rising mainstream popularity and awareness of cryptocurrencies, owning and trading cryptocurrency has never been easier. We are a cryptocurrency project that is creating an exciting, innovative and extraordinary trading exchange which is birth with the goal of combining and linking investors to an interactive exchange that also features non-fungible tokens (NFT). This is just part of an eco-system which allows investors to have a seamless and an experience apart of the usual run of the mill exchanges.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are also entering a tumultuous period not just in the United States of America but apparently, the whole entire world. When cryptos enters the global market, there were requirements for exchanging which is just the same as going for a holiday and heading over to the money exchanger. With this came the rise of many major cryptocurrency exchanges that came into existence. So, people had difficulties finding the best crypto exchanges. Here in 2023, Linux aims to have a suite of applications which investors are able to have a premium sense of not just trading but also having that edge which allows them to stay beyond the hectic and sometimes stressful trading environment. 


Introducing the features for Linux Exchange. 


"Spot trading" 
Spot markets include sellers, buyers and order books. Sellers make an order with a specific ask or sell price, and buyers place an order for any cryptocurrency token with a particular bid or purchase price. The fees here at Linux Exchange stands at 0.1% per trade.


"Futures Trading"
Futures trading refers to a method of speculating on the price of assets, including cryptocurrencies, without actually owning them. Like commodity or stock futures, cryptocurrency futures enable traders to get in on a digital currency’s future price. Max leverage is currently capped at 50x.


"Demo Account"
Demo Account feature is able to give investors young or old an opportunity to either hone their trading skillset or serves as a stepping stone for the newbies. Trading by itself is already a very dauting task even for the experienced proffessional. We have decided to launch this feature to hopefully and eventually get the investors to be onboarded with our exchange for the foreseeable future.
